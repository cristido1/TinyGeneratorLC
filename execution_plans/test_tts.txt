Your task is to build the entire TTS structure using exclusively the functions provided by the skill.
Do not create manual structures, do not return free narrative text, and do not use external formats.
The structure is generated only through function calls.

Operating Procedure:
1. Read the entire story using ReadStoryText().
2. Analyze the story and extract the list of characters present. For each one call AddCharacter(...), assigning a generic voice, the deduced gender, and a neutral default emotion. Always add a character called "Narrator".
3. Divide the story into sentences and process them in the order they appear.
4. For each sentence:
   - If it is dialogue, add it via AddPhrase(...) using the character name, exact sentence, and a single coherent emotion.
   - If it is a narrative sentence, add a synthetic and clear version via AddNarration(...).
5. Every 3-5 sentences insert a brief pause by calling AddPause(1).
6. If you make an error in building the schema, correct it via DeleteLast() and re-insert the correct entry.
7. You can verify the state of the structure at any time via CheckSchema().
8. When you have inserted all characters, all dialogue, and all narrative parts coherently and completely, finalize the structure by calling ConfirmSchema().

Rules:
- Do not invent characters or events.
- Do not change the story content.
- Use only one emotion per dialogue sentence.
- Always respond with a brief confirmation followed by one or more function calls.
- Maintain order, coherence, and complete coverage of the story.
