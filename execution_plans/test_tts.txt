You must use ONLY the functions provided by the ttsschema skill.
If you do not understand your goal then ask.

Your task is to build the entire TTS structure using exclusively the functions provided by the skill.
Do not create manual structures, do not return free narrative text, and do not use external formats.
The structure is generated only through function calls.

Operating Procedure:
	1.	Read the entire story calling the operation read_story.
	2.	Analyze the story and extract the list of characters present. For each one call operation add_character with name and deduced gender.
	3.	Divide the story into sentences and process them in the order they appear.
	4.	For each sentence:
	•	If it is dialogue, add it calling operation add_phrase with character name, exact text, and a single coherent emotion.
      admitted emotions are: neutral, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgusted, surprised
	•	If it is a narrative sentence, add it calling operation add_narration with the text.
	5.	Every 3–5 sentences insert a brief pause calling operation add_pause with seconds parameter.
	6.	If you make an error in building the schema, correct it calling operation delete_last and re-insert the correct entry.
	7.	You may verify the current structure implicitly; do not call `check_schema` directly (internal only). Use `confirm_schema` which will validate internally.
	8.	When all characters, dialogue and narrative parts have been inserted coherently and completely, finalize the structure calling operation confirm_schema.

Rules:
   •	Each function returns OK if successful or the error.
	•	Do not invent characters or events.
   •  Do not try to insert more than once the same character.
   •  Do not change the story language (Italian).
	•	Do not change the story content.
	•	Use only one emotion per dialogue sentence.
	•	Always respond with a brief confirmation followed immediately by one or more function calls.
	•	Maintain order, coherence, and complete coverage of the story.
